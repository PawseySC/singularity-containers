> To run exercises from this episode on your own, you'll need a machine with MPICH libraries and Slurm scheduler installed.  
> If you only have MPICH but not Slurm, you can achieve the same outcomes below by executing `./mpi_mpirun.sh` in substitution for `sbatch mpi_sc19.sh`.

### Let's run OpenFoam in a container!

We're going to start this episode with actually running a practical example, and then discuss the way this all works later on.  
We're using OpenFoam, a widely popular package for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, which is able to massively scale in parallel architectures up to thousands of processes, by leveraging an MPI library.  
The sample inputs come straight from the OpenFoam installation tree, namely `$FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/pimpleFoam/LES/periodicHill/steadyState/`.

First, let us cd into the demo directory, ensure that `$SIFPATH` is defined, and verify that the OpenFoam container image has been downloaded:

```
$ cd $SC19/demos/07_openfoam
$ export SIFPATH=$SC19/demos/sif
$ ls $SIFPATH/openfoam*.sif
```
{: .bash}

```
/home/ubuntu/sc19-containers/demos/sif/openfoam_v1812.sif
```
{: .output}

Now, let us use the Slurm scheduler to submit the job script `mpi_sc19.sh`, that will run the sample simulation:

```
$ sbatch mpi_sc19.sh
```
{: .bash}

The run will take a couple of minutes. When it's finished, the directory contents will look a bit like this one:

```
$ ls -ltr
```
{: .bash}

```

```
{: .output}

We ran using *2** MPI* processes, who created outputs in the directories `processor0` and `processor1`, respectively. The final reconstruction creates results in the directory `20` (which stands for the *20th* and last simulation step in this very short demo run).

What has just happened?


### A batch script for MPI applications with containers

Let's have a look at the content of the script (`mpi_sc19.sh`) we executed through the scheduler:

```
#!/bin/bash -l


#SBATCH --job-name=mpi
#SBATCH --ntasks=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
#SBATCH --time=00:20:00


# this configuration depends on the host
export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/opt/mpich/mpich-3.1.4/apps"
export SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/mpich/mpich-3.1.4/apps/lib"


# pre-processing
srun -n 1 \
  singularity exec $SIFPATH/openfoam_v1812.sif \
  blockMesh | tee log.blockMesh

srun -n 1 \
  singularity exec $SIFPATH/openfoam_v1812.sif \
  topoSet | tee log.topoSet

srun -n 1 \
  singularity exec $SIFPATH/openfoam_v1812.sif \
  decomposePar -fileHandler collated | tee log.decomposePar


# run OpenFoam with MPI
srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS \
  singularity exec $SIFPATH/openfoam_v1812.sif \
  simpleFoam -fileHandler collated -parallel | tee log.simpleFoam


# post-processing
srun -n 1 \
  singularity exec $SIFPATH/openfoam_v1812.sif \
  reconstructPar -latestTime -fileHandler collated | tee log.reconstructPar
```
{: .bash}


### How does Singularity interplay with the MPI launcher?

We'll comment on the environment variable definitions soon, now let's focus on the set of `srun` commands that make the simulation happen.

The general syntax is something like:

```
srun --export=all -n <no-of-processes> \
  singularity exec <image-name> \
  <command> <arguments>
```
{: .bash}

Here, `srun` is the Slurm wrapper for the MPI launcher, *i.e.* the tool that is in charge for spawning the multiple MPI processes that will make the workflow run in parallel. Other schedulers might require a different command. If no scheduler is used, this will just be `mpirun`. **Note**: the `srun` flags might be different with different launchers, too.  
Note how `singularity` can be executed through the launcher as any other application would.

Under the hood, the MPI process outside of the container (spawned by `srun`) will work in tandem with the containerized MPI code to instantiate the job.  
There are a few implications here..


### Requirements for the MPI + container combo

Let's discuss what the above mentioned implications are.

* A host MPI installation must be present to spawn the MPI processes.

* An MPI installation is required in the container, to compile the application.  
A specific section of the recipe file needs to take care of this, or in alternative the base image for the recipe needs to have the MPI libraries. Either way, if we take the example of a *def file* for the *MPICH* flavour of MPI, the code would look like:

```
MPICH_VERSION="3.1.4"
MPICH_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--enable-fast=all,O3 --prefix=/usr"

mkdir -p /tmp/mpich-build
cd /tmp/mpich-build

wget http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/${MPICH_VERSION}/mpich-${MPICH_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar xvzf mpich-${MPICH_VERSION}.tar.gz

cd mpich-${MPICH_VERSION}

./configure ${MPICH_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS}
make
make install

ldconfig
```
{: .bash}

> ## Base MPI image at Pawsey
>
> Pawsey maintains an MPICH base image at [pawsey/mpi-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/pawsey/mpi-base).  
> At the moment, only a Docker image is provided, which of course can also be used by Singularity.
{: .callout}


* The container and host MPI installations need to be *ABI* (Application Binary Interface) *compatible*. This is because the application in the container is built with the former but then run with the latter.  
At present, there are just two families of MPI implementations, not ABI compatible with each other: MPICH (with IntelMPI and MVAPICH) and OpenMPI.  
If you anticipate your application will run in systems with non ABI compatible libraries, you will need to build variants of the image for the two MPI families.

> ## MPI implementations at Pawsey
>
> At present, all Pawsey systems have installed at least one MPICH ABI compatible implementation: CrayMPICH on the Crays (*Magnus* and *Galaxy), IntelMPI on *Zeus*. Therefore, MPICH is the recommended MPI library to install in container images.
{: .callout}


* Bind mounts and environment variables need to be setup so that the containerised MPI application can use the host MPI libraries at runtime. Bind mounts can be configured by the administrators, or set up through variables. We're discussing the latter way here.  
In the current example we have:

```
export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/opt/mpich/mpich-3.1.4/apps"
export SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/mpich/mpich-3.1.4/apps/lib"
```
{: .bash}

Here, the first variable bind mounts the host path where the MPI installation is (MPICH in this case).  
The second variable ensures that at runtime the container's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` has the path to the MPICH libraries.

> ## Interconnect libraries and containers
>
> If the HPC system you're using has high speed interconnect infrastructure, than it will also have some system libraries to handle that at the application level. These libraries will need to be exposed to the containers, too, similar to the MPI libraries, if maximum performance are to be achieved.  
> This can be a challenging task for a user, as it requires knowing details on the installed software stack. System administrators should be able to assist in this regard.
{: .callout}

> ## Singularity environment variables at Pawsey
>
> In all Pawsey systems, the Singularity module sets up all of the required variables for MPI and interconnect libraries. So this will do the job:
>
> ```
> $ module load singularity
> ```
> {: .bash}
{: .callout}


### MPI performance: container *vs* bare metal

What's the performance overhead in running an MPI application through containers?  
Well, the benchmark figures just below reveal it's quite small..good news!

> ## Running this example at Pawsey
>
> If you try and run this on *Magnus* at Pawsey,
> you might want to use the script `mpi_pawsey.sh`.  
> The key differences compared to the one discussed above are:
> * using `module load singularity` rather than defining environment variables;
> * declaring the Pawsey Project ID through a `#SBATCH` directive.
>
> Then you can just use the following submission command:
> ```
> $ sbatch mpi_pawsey.sh
> ```
> {: .bash}
{: .callout}


> ## Running this example with *mpirun* without Slurm
>
> If you want to run this example without schedulers, you might want to execute the provided script `mpi_mpirun.sh`.
