### Structure

This tutorial has been designed in a modular way.

Episodes can be thought as categorised as follows:
* Getting Started (Core): eps. 1-4
* Customising Containers: eps. 5-8
* Scaling to HPC: eps. 9-11
* Bonus Episodes: eps. 12-15
* Other Tools: eps. 16-17

Once you've gone through the Core episodes 1-4, there are almost no further dependencies.  You can go on and pick whichever you are interested in, and you will be able to follow through.
