## Structure

This tutorial has been designed in a modular way.  Episodes can be thought as categorised as follows:
* Getting Started (Core): eps. 1-4 <!--\[ watch [webinar 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InvDom3dec8) \]-->
* Customising Containers: eps. 5-8 <!--\[ watch [webinar 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e4nVO1vWrw) \]-->
* Scaling to HPC: eps. 9-11 <!--\[ watch [webinar 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYnWTFJdZ-Y) \]-->
* Bonus Episodes: eps. 12-15
* Other Tools: eps. 16-18

Once you've gone through Episodes 1-5, there are almost no further dependencies.  You can go on and pick whichever you are interested in, and you will be able to follow through.
